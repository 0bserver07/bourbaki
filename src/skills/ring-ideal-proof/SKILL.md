# Ring and Ideal Proof

Prove properties of rings using ideals, quotient constructions, and the correspondence between ideals and quotients.

## The Key Insight

Ideals are kernels of ring homomorphisms. The structure of R/I reveals properties of both R and I. Prime and maximal ideals correspond to domains and fields.

## Step 1: Verify Ideal Properties

An ideal I of ring R must satisfy:
- [ ] (I, +) is a subgroup of (R, +)
- [ ] For all r ∈ R and a ∈ I: ra ∈ I and ar ∈ I (absorption)

### Checking Ideal

To prove I is an ideal:
```
1. 0 ∈ I: [show zero is in I]
2. Closure under +: If a, b ∈ I, then a + b = ... ∈ I
3. Additive inverses: If a ∈ I, then -a = ... ∈ I
4. Absorption: If r ∈ R and a ∈ I, then ra = ... ∈ I
```

### Common Ideal Types

| Notation | Definition | Generated by |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| (a) | Principal ideal | Single element a |
| (a, b) | Two-generated | Elements a and b |
| (a₁, ..., aₙ) | Finitely generated | Elements a₁, ..., aₙ |
| I + J | Sum | {a + b : a ∈ I, b ∈ J} |
| IJ | Product | {Σ aᵢbᵢ : aᵢ ∈ I, bᵢ ∈ J} |
| I ∩ J | Intersection | Set intersection |

## Step 2: Classify the Ideal

### Prime Ideal
I is **prime** if I ≠ R and:
```
ab ∈ I ⟹ a ∈ I or b ∈ I
```

**Equivalent:** R/I is an integral domain.

### Maximal Ideal
I is **maximal** if I ≠ R and:
```
I ⊆ J ⊆ R ⟹ J = I or J = R
```

**Equivalent:** R/I is a field.

### Key Relationships

```
Maximal ⟹ Prime (in commutative rings with 1)

I maximal ⟺ R/I is a field
I prime ⟺ R/I is an integral domain
```

## Step 3: Work with Quotient Rings

### Elements of R/I
The quotient ring R/I consists of cosets:
```
R/I = { r + I : r ∈ R }
```

### Operations in R/I
```
(a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I
(a + I) · (b + I) = (ab) + I
```

### Zero Divisors
a + I is a zero divisor in R/I ⟺ ∃b ∉ I such that ab ∈ I.

### Units
a + I is a unit in R/I ⟺ ∃b such that ab - 1 ∈ I ⟺ 1 ∈ (a) + I.

## Step 4: Apply Ring Isomorphism Theorems

### First Isomorphism Theorem
If φ: R → S is a ring homomorphism:
```
R / ker(φ) ≅ im(φ)
```

### Correspondence Theorem
Ideals of R/I correspond bijectively to ideals of R containing I:
```
J/I ↔ J where I ⊆ J ⊆ R
```

Moreover:
- J/I is prime in R/I ⟺ J is prime in R
- J/I is maximal in R/I ⟺ J is maximal in R

### Chinese Remainder Theorem
If I + J = R (coprime ideals):
```
R / (I ∩ J) ≅ R/I × R/J
```

## Example: Prove (p) is Maximal in ℤ

**Problem:** Show that for prime p, the ideal (p) = pℤ is maximal in ℤ.

**Proof:**

We show ℤ/(p) is a field.

The elements of ℤ/(p) are: {0̄, 1̄, 2̄, ..., p̄-1̄}

**ℤ/(p) is an integral domain:**
If āb̄ = 0̄, then p | ab.
Since p is prime and p | ab, we have p | a or p | b.
Thus ā = 0̄ or b̄ = 0̄.

**ℤ/(p) is a field:**
Since ℤ/(p) is a finite integral domain, it is a field.
(Every nonzero element has finite multiplicative order, hence is a unit.)

Alternatively: For any ā ≠ 0̄, gcd(a, p) = 1 since p is prime.
By Bezout: ∃s, t: sa + tp = 1, so s̄ā = 1̄, giving ā⁻¹ = s̄.

Since ℤ/(p) is a field, (p) is maximal. ∎

## Example: Ideal Containment

**Problem:** In ℤ[x], show that (x, 2) ⊋ (x² + 2).

**Proof:**

We need to show (x² + 2) ⊆ (x, 2) and (x² + 2) ≠ (x, 2).

**Containment:**
x² + 2 = x · x + 2 · 1 ∈ (x, 2)
Therefore (x² + 2) ⊆ (x, 2).

**Proper:**
Suppose (x, 2) = (x² + 2). Then x ∈ (x² + 2).
So x = f(x) · (x² + 2) for some f(x) ∈ ℤ[x].
Comparing degrees: deg(x) = 1, but deg(f(x) · (x² + 2)) ≥ 2 for f ≠ 0.
If f = 0, then x = 0, contradiction.
Therefore (x, 2) ≠ (x² + 2), so (x² + 2) ⊊ (x, 2). ∎

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Zero ring:** The zero ring has (0) = R, which is both prime and maximal by some definitions but not others
2. **Non-commutative rings:** Left ideals ≠ right ideals ≠ two-sided ideals
3. **Proper ideal:** Prime and maximal require I ≠ R
4. **Containment direction:** (a) ⊆ (b) ⟺ b | a in a PID
5. **Product vs. intersection:** IJ ⊆ I ∩ J always, but equality requires conditions

## Advanced Techniques

### Localization
R_P (localization at prime P) makes elements outside P invertible:
```
R_P = { r/s : r ∈ R, s ∉ P }
```
Unique maximal ideal: PR_P.

### Nilradical and Jacobson Radical
- Nilradical: √(0) = ∩{P : P prime} = {a : aⁿ = 0 for some n}
- Jacobson radical: J(R) = ∩{M : M maximal}

### Primary Decomposition
In Noetherian rings, every ideal is an intersection of primary ideals.
